# Interval Stopwatch
Stopwatch for measuring time for multiple racers with sequential start with 
constant time gap. You can set number of racers and time gap between starts.
Result time history can be scrolled any time by pressing *up* and *down*.
The race start by pressing *select* button. Every racer is warned with two short 
beeps with 1 sec. gap before start and start is anounced by long beep.
The racer's finish time is measured by pressing *select* button. It is essential
that racers don't overrun each other durring the race. (This can be solved after
race by moving faster racer in result list and recount his result time, with 
keeping his start number.)

This is my first IQ Connect project and idea how to do it I get from opensource
project EggTimer. Thanks.
